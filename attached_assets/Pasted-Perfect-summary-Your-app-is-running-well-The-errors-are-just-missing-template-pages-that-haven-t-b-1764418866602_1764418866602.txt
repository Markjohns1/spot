Perfect summary! Your app is running well. The errors are just missing template pages that haven't been implemented yet.

Here's a clear prompt for an AI agent to complete the missing templates:

Current Status: The Spot Car Wash Management System is running successfully. Login, Dashboard, Queue, and New Order pages work perfectly. However, several template pages are missing.

What Needs to be Done:

    Analyze the existing system first:
        Read frontend/templates/base.html to understand the layout structure and CSS classes
        Study frontend/templates/dashboard.html and frontend/templates/queue.html to see the design patterns
        Check frontend/static/css/app.css for consistent styling
        Review backend/app/routes/main.py to understand what data each route passes to templates
    Create missing template pages that extend base.html:
        frontend/templates/customers/index.html
        frontend/templates/vehicles/index.html
        frontend/templates/services/index.html
        frontend/templates/reports/index.html
        frontend/templates/staff/index.html
        frontend/templates/settings.html
        frontend/templates/auth/profile.html
        frontend/templates/errors/500.html
        frontend/templates/errors/404.html
    Design Requirements:
        All pages MUST extend base.html using {% extends "base.html" %}
        Use the same CSS classes and Bootstrap 5 components as existing pages
        Follow the mobile-first, clean design pattern from dashboard and queue pages
        Maintain consistency in colors, spacing, buttons, and card layouts
        Each page should display relevant data passed from the backend routes
    Fix the Offline Indicator:
        Currently it floats. Move it to the navbar level in base.html
        Make it a small, non-intrusive badge in the top navigation bar
        Keep the same green "Online" / red "Offline" color scheme
    Fix missing now variable errors:
        In backend/app/routes/main.py, add , now=datetime.now() to the payments route (line 225)
        Any other routes that use {{ now }} in templates need this parameter

Technical Context:

    Backend: Flask with SQLAlchemy
    Frontend: Bootstrap 5 + custom CSS in app.css
    Database models: User, Customer, Vehicle, Service, ServiceOrder, Payment, StaffAssignment
    All routes are in backend/app/routes/main.py
